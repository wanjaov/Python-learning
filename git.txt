Git is a version control sytem (vcs) that is free and open source.

Creating a local repository
1.Git init . - This done within your project directory
--> We also create a .gitignore file, where we store anything we would not want to be uplosded online. This may include: secret sensitive files, bulky and unnecessary folders such as an environment folder, and anything else which isnt necessary to people we are collaborating with
2. git add. / git add "filename" eg : git and "OOP.py"
3. git commit - m "Added a functionality X"
4. git push origin master


LINKING LOCAL REPOSITORY WITH REMOTE REPOSITORY
git remote add origin[REMOTE_REPOSITORY LINK]


AUTHENTICATING INTO GITHUB FROM OUR LOCAL REPO & TERMINAL
Configurations of username and email:
1. User email: git config --global user.email "youremail@gmail.com"
2. User name:  git config --global user.name "yourgithubusername"

3. Registering your ssh-key with github.com: An ssh-key is an unique identity string that is used to identify a specific computer, so asto give it access to a particular areas of a system. In this case github uses our ssh keys to identify our computers and give them access to our github account.

Part of an ssh key:
a. Private key: this identity should only be known within our local PC, we dont give it out to online systems eg github
b. Public key: this identity is known both within our local PC and this is what we share with online system/server for them to give us particular permisssions

HOW TO GENERATE AN SSH key
-->Ensure that you have ssh-keygen installed
-->In your terminal run the command:\> ssh-keygen, it will prompt you with several parameters you can find it. You can choose to fill them or blank leave them the last one indicates the location of your ssh-key i.e the folder where you can find it . You can note this somewhere. This generates two important files: id_rsa, which is what willcontain your pblic ssh key. You can access the public key generated by using the command:
:\> cat path/to/ssh/folder/id_rsa.pub
EG:\> cat -/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 
the cat command fetches the content of a file, in read only format, in this case we will be able to see the value of our public key, which we can copy to our github.
