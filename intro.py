Introduction
-Python is an interpreted and non typed language created to make programming easier.

Use cases
1.Web development (Mainly backend)- Using frameworks such as django, flask and API, which are built from python you can be able to create your own backend infrastructure.
2.Data  Science- Python is rich in libraries that can be used in data science.
3.Cyber security-Python is used to generate scripts used in penetration testing , reverse engineering and social engineering 

Syntax 
1. Comments
 a. We can comment a single line by '#'
 b. We comment multiple lines using '''comment here'''

 2. Outputting text: We can use function print() to output text data in our terminal python
 i.e: print("Hello world")

 3. Inputing data: We input data using the function input (), which expects from a user.

 4. Variables: Variables in python dont have any keywords during defination, we just take in the variable name and give it value and constants will use uppercase while local ones
 (defined within a file or a class or function), will use lower casing.

 5.Naming convections:  Python use snake case for its naming convection
 6. How to run a pyhton program
    a. Open your terminal
    b. Navigate to the directory with the given program 
    c. Run python followed by the program's name i.e python intro.py
"""

#This is a single line comment
#Outputing hello world in python
print("Hello world")

# Creating variables in python
x = 10
print(x)

# x = "Ten"
# print(x)

print(x+9)

#Prompting user for input
user_input = input("Input your name:")
print(user_input)

#   TODO Create a file, name it example.py, create a program to take in a company name and output it
